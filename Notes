// Notes:

// positioning of things gets weird when zooming
//need to maintain position of operators and drawings
//when zooming and also need to make the pen tool
// work where the mouse/input is rather than where it
// is in space, when zoomed the drawing is not in the right place

// could move position of floor buttons

// need to add gadgets and things menu for each operator
// this includes an area for each character used

//I think i want to adjust how the scrolling, zoomng and panning works,
//I would like to have it so that, using the scroll wheel just zooms in and out?
// then holding a ctrl + scroll would move the map up and down
// holding shift + scroll would move the map sideways


// ALL ANNOTATIONS ARE OFFSET TO THE mouse

//  Eraser only works with clicking and not holding

// Annotations stay on the floor they are drawn on even after switching to a new map, I think this is a good thing, but just noting behaviours
